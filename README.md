## 🌟 The Problem This Solves

Most analytics tools only detect frustration *after* users leave — through bounce rates, churn metrics, or support tickets. By then, it's too late.

This system detects **silent frustration in real time**, using behavioral signals like rage-clicks, page revisits, and idle time — *without requiring any user feedback*. It then explains *why* a user is flagged, making the output actionable for product and UX teams.

## 🧠 What Makes This Project Stand Out

| Capability | What It Shows |
|---|---|
| Behavioral ML (no explicit feedback) | Understands UX signals beyond surveys |
| SHAP → Plain-English explanations | Explainability for non-technical stakeholders |
| Model comparison (RF vs LR) | Principled model selection, not tutorial copying |
| Threshold slider (Precision vs Recall) | Business tradeoff thinking |
| Risk profile labels 🔴🟡🟢 | Product thinking, not just model demos |
| Grounded synthetic data | Synthetic user sessions generated from realistic frustration-related behavioral patterns |

---

## 🚀 Live Demo — Dashboard Features

### 1. 🔴🟡🟢 Risk Profile with Auto-Generated Reason
Instead of just a score (`0.73`), users see:

> 🔴 **High Risk** — *"Rage-click pattern detected (14 rapid clicks) + 3 page revisits in session"*

The reason is auto-generated from the **top SHAP contributor** — translating model internals into a sentence a product manager can act on.

### 2. 📊 Plain-English SHAP Explainability
Below every SHAP waterfall plot:
> *"This user's frustration is mainly driven by 14 rapid clicks in 30 seconds and an error rate of 6 — well above the frustration threshold."*

### 3. ⚖️ Business-Aware Threshold Slider
Adjust the decision threshold (0.3 → 0.7) and watch Precision and Recall update live:

| Use Case | Threshold | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Customer support trigger | 0.40 | High recall — catch more, tolerate false positives |
| Push notification / alert | 0.60 | High precision — only alert when confident |
| Research & analysis | 0.50 | Balanced default |
| Real-time UX intervention | 0.35 | Catch early signals before drop-off |

### 4. 🧪 Model Comparison Table

| Model | Accuracy | F1 (Frustrated) | Interpretable? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Logistic Regression** | **98%** | **0.97** | ✅ Coefficients |
| Random Forest | 94% | 0.90 | ✅ SHAP |

Although Logistic Regression achieved higher accuracy on the synthetic dataset, Random Forest was selected as the primary model for its superior SHAP-based explainability and stronger ability to model non-linear behavioral patterns likely to occur in real-world user sessions.

## 📊 Dataset

**Type:** Synthetic behavioral dataset, grounded in UX research thresholds
*(e.g., rage-click threshold: >10 clicks/30s; idle frustration threshold: >90s — sourced from Nielsen Norman Group behavioral research)*

| Feature | Description | Frustration Signal |
|---|---|---|
| `rapid_clicks` | Clicks in a short burst | Rage-click pattern |
| `error_count` | Errors encountered in session | UI/flow confusion |
| `page_revisits` | Repeated visits to same page | Disorientation |
| `idle_time` | User inactivity duration | Stuck / confused |
| `session_duration` | Total session length | Context for other signals |
| `num_clicks` | Total number of clicks | General engagement |
| `scroll_depth` | How far down the user scrolled | Engagement indicator |

**Target:** `1` = Frustrated User, `0` = Non-Frustrated User

## 🔬 Explainable AI — Why It Matters

SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) was chosen over simpler feature importance because it:

- Explains **individual predictions**, not just global patterns
- Shows **directional impact** — does a feature push the prediction toward frustrated or not?
- Enables **plain-English translation** for non-technical stakeholders

This system doesn't just predict frustration — it tells you *why*, which is the gap between a research demo and a production UX tool.
